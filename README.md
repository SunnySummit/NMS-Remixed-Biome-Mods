# Plumgen EXML Updated Biome Mod Collection
updated EXML for legacy no man's sky biome mods

this is my collection of mods i've spent time updating to newer versions of no man's sky using my app, [Plumgen](https://github.com/SunnySummit/PLUMGEN).

to use one of these mods, download a selected 'EXMLs' folder (e.g. using [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)), then locate and import each 'BIOMES' folder (if you only see 'Biomes' you'll need to navigate deeper into the folder structure for 'BIOMES') via. Plumgen, then export. this updates the mod so you can play legacy mods in modern no man's sky. :D

please note: mods included in this collection use open permissions. view a mod's mod page for details about their permissions:
