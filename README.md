# No Man's Sky - Remixed Biome Mods
remixed legacy no man's sky biome mods

this is my collection of biome mods i've remixed to newer versions of NMS using my program [Plumgen](https://github.com/SunnySummit/PLUMGEN)

---

i'm making this because:
1. it's fun
2. i imagine most modders don't want their work to be forgotten

---

to use one of these mods, download a selected 'EXMLs' folder (e.g. using [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)), then locate and import each 'BIOMES' folder* via. Plumgen, then export. this updates the mod so you can play legacy mods in the newest versions of no man's sky. more info on how to import [in this youtube video](https://youtu.be/zzaeyRAobOQ?t=450).

*if you only see 'Biomes', search deeper in the folder structure for 'BIOMES'

*some mods contain multiple 'BIOMES' subfolders. Plumgen can import multiple 'BIOMES' folders if you simply add a number at the end of one, like 'BIOMES2' which i've already done for you. :)

- note 1: if a mod author wants me to remove a remixed version of their mod, just say so.
- note 2: open an issue if you're confused or concerned about something.
