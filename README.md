# No Man's Sky - Remixed Biome Mods
remixed legacy no man's sky biome mods

this is my collection of biome mods i've remixed/updated to newer versions of no man's sky using my program, [Plumgen](https://github.com/SunnySummit/PLUMGEN).

i'm making this because:
A) it's fun.
B) i imagine most modders don't want their work to be forgotten.

to use one of these mods, download a selected 'EXMLs' folder (e.g. using [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)), then locate and import each 'BIOMES' folder** via. Plumgen, then export. this updates the mod so you can play legacy mods in the newest versions of no man's sky. more info on how to import [in this youtube video](https://youtu.be/zzaeyRAobOQ?t=450). simply click export after importing.

**if you only see 'Biomes', search deeper in the folder structure for 'BIOMES'

note 1: mods included in this collection are either very old or use open permissions. if a mod author doesn't want me to share a remixed version of their mod, just say so and i'll take it down.
note 2: if you're confused or concerned about something, feel free to open an issue.

view a mod's page for more details about the mod:

finally, i might include PAK files for easy modding, mainly for people coming from youtube who want to quickly try out a new remixed mod. i don't have time, however, to update or maintain them.
