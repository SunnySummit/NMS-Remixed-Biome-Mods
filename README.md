# No Man's Sky - Remixed Biome Mods
remixed legacy no man's sky biome mods

this is my collection of biome mods i've remixed to newer versions of NMS using my program [Plumgen](https://github.com/SunnySummit/PLUMGEN)

---

i'm making this because:
1. it's fun
2. i imagine most modders don't want their work to be forgotten

---

to use one of these mods, download a selected 'EXMLs' folder (e.g. using [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)), then locate and import each 'BIOMES' folder** via. Plumgen, then export. this updates the mod so you can play legacy mods in the newest versions of no man's sky. more info on how to import [in this youtube video](https://youtu.be/zzaeyRAobOQ?t=450).

**if you only see 'Biomes', search deeper in the folder structure for 'BIOMES'

- note 1: if a mod author wants me to remove a remixed version of their mod, just say so.
- note 2: open an issue if you're confused or concerned about something.

view a mod's page for more details about the mod:

finally, i might include PAK files (in folders) for easy modding, mainly for people coming from youtube who want to quickly try out a new remixed mod. i will not, however, update or maintain PAKs. you can do so using the steps mentioned above :)
